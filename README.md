# Submarine-Rock-vs-Mine


## Overview
In this project, we embarked on a comprehensive exploration of various classification methods, with a primary focus on assessing and comparing their accuracy and precision. The objective was to gain insights into the performance of these methods in solving classification problems and to identify their relative strengths and weaknesses. The methods under scrutiny encompassed a diverse array of approaches, including XGBoost, Logistic Regression, Neural Network Classification,Random forests and Histogram-Based Classification.

The primary motivation behind this analysis was to make informed decisions about which classification method would best suit the problem at hand, ensuring that the chosen method aligns with the specific requirements of the task. The assessment of accuracy and precision served as a pivotal metric in this endeavor, offering valuable insights into the models' overall effectiveness and their ability to minimize both false positives and false negatives.

Throughout the course of the project, we carefully examined the behavior of each classification method, delving into their algorithmic intricacies and parameter tuning. By comparing the accuracy and precision of these methods, we aimed to understand their performance across a range of diverse datasets and real-world scenarios.

The results of this analysis provide a comprehensive perspective on the classification methods considered, shedding light on their relative performance and their suitability for different tasks. The findings generated in this study empower us to make informed decisions when selecting the most appropriate classification method based on the specific requirements and trade-offs of a given problem. Furthermore, this analysis contributes to a deeper understanding of the intricate dynamics between accuracy and precision and their implications for decision-making in the realm of classification modeling.

## Analysis

### Accuracy Comparison

Include a summary or table that compares the accuracy achieved by each classification method. This can be a quantitative comparison, such as a table of accuracy scores, or a summary of the findings. For example:

| Method                    | Accuracy |
|---------------------------|----------|
| Logistic Regression       | 0.73     |
| XGBoost                   | 0.84     |
| Neural Network            | 0.80     |
| Random Forest             | 0.80     |

### Precision Comparison

Include a summary or table that compares the precision achieved by each classification method. Like the accuracy comparison, this can be a quantitative comparison or a summary of the findings. For example:
